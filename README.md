This repository contains C code for generating book data, analyzing time complexity, and testing book division algorithms. Below are the instructions for compiling and running the code using Visual Studio Code.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and the user interface.
- `book_division.c`: Contains functions related to generating book data, analyzing time complexity, and testing book division algorithms.
- `book_division.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

1. **Install Visual Studio Code:** If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Extensions:** Install the necessary extensions for C/C++ development in Visual Studio Code. You can use extensions like "C/C++" by Microsoft.

## Compiling and Running the Code

Follow these steps to compile and run the C code in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Open Visual Studio Code:** Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder containing the project files.

2. **Open Terminal:** Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by selecting Terminal > New Terminal from the top menu.

3. **Compile the Code:** In the terminal, use the following command to compile the code:gcc -o main main.c books_div.c data_gen.c rand.bk_gen.c
